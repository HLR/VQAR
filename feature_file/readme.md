## TODO
<!-- 1. generate the key:value map between entity2id and isa_relation (DONE)
2. process the case the '/' in the entity. ('/' is space, but in relateion file, "_" is space. So I united them as "_")
3. increase the entity in the entity2id. (DONE) -->
<!-- 4. There are bugs in the generated relation file. The value should be list rather than string. (DONE) -->

## entity_rel.json: 
isa relation for each entity

## entity2id_new1.json
entity2id file without increase entity from relation file

## entity2id_new2.json
entity2id file with increase entity from relation file
